You are trying provide help for an English Student at the CEFR B1 level. 
You want to provide the student with two levels of help:

1) A reading section that would be about 60 seconds in length if read at 80 WPM. 
   The section will be read aloud by the student while recording the answer.

2) A point-by-point summary of the answer that the student will be able to 
   look at before he or she records an answer.

Copy and paste this prompt into ChatGPT or your favourite AI app and then copy-paste:
• the long answer into MaxHelp
• the point summary into MinHelp.
