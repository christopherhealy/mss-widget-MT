Let's take a moment now and define our security approach and then implement it.

1. School decides on limit - we need this anyway as we are billing them and we want to provide a logging of all results we passed to them as a report. 
2. In config we present that limit to the Admin
3. we have a limit encroachment process for the Admin - please up your limit or set the service off
4. We have a test on limit so we can provide a nice message for the student - when the school page is loaded and the iFrame is about to be set, we test there. If exceeded, we hide the iFrame and log the attempt for the Admin. We notify the Admin by email? (option set in config - "email me if iFrame not visible)
5. We do not worry about 4772 being visible in the iFrame - low risk we accept.
6. We create a policy page - Security policy.....so the customer can accept it (or not). We ask the customer or acknowledge the policy before starting the service.

If you are OK with that, then let's spend a minute and write that up - for us (help us with our prompt) and for the customer and then let's bake that in today and get that working step by step. 

For QA we can mimic the MySpeakingScore sign up and the school page where the iFrame lives. We can create a demo school Widget Academy.
