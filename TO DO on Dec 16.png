But time to clean up a few items.



5. On the InviteSchoolSignup email form, the Send fails "required subject and message" even though those are already filled (and modified).
6. Dash 3 is not working
7. Let's mimic the pink widget and get that working	
8. Change Schools confirmation - show in dialog (now in section) ???

10. In the AI prompt - see Andrew's email
11, -- minor item - on the close the School Signup it takes me to the Admin page - in this case the person filling it in is not yet an admin - so it should just close.

Save in Help editor FIXED
Embed script is broken FIXED
Check Vox gauge

Build the funnel!

So that's some housekeeping for us.
