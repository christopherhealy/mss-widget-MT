  <p>Imagine you are explaining your opinion to a friend who disagrees
  with you. Speak slowly and clearly and use full sentences.</p>

  <p>First, give your opinion directly. Then, explain one main reason with
  a short story from your life. After that, add a second reason and a
  simple conclusion.</p>
